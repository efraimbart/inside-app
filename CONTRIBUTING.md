Check out items labeled [Good First Issue](https://github.com/yringler/inside-app/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) for issues which
should only require a good flutter knowlage, but shouldn't be enourmously complex or require deep knowlage of the inner workings and design of the app.'

Issues labeled [blocked](https://github.com/yringler/inside-app/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ablocked) are mostly related to data handling,
which is currently undergoing a thorough rewrite, and any work done now would have to be discarded, and will be much easier after the [data update](https://github.com/yringler/inside-app/pull/89) is finished.

Others, such as [accesibility](https://github.com/yringler/inside-app/issues/92), could technically be worked on now by anyone, but probably require more familiarity with the app, as well as an idea of all the accessibility stuff.
