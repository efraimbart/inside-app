# App and plugin mono-repo

The Inside Chassidus App

And the just_audio_handlers plugin with default audio_service / just_audio implementation, which has extra goodies like
persist position.

Possibly, if just_audio_handlers stabalizes, and other's are interested in using / hacking on it, it will be moved to its own
repository.
